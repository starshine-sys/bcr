# bcr

Interaction router for [Arikawa](https://github.com/diamondburned/arikawa).

This is a full rewrite of the [original bcr](https://github.com/starshine-sys/bcr/tree/main/), focusing entirely on interactions (commands, components, and modals). It's designed to work with both a standard `*state.State` and a shard manager.
